## !! Very early stages of development !!

## Spotify + Gps-like remote for your car - ESP32 based
### Designed to break from the "SMART" screens and smartphones while driving
The point is that to make a "thing" that can handle common spotify controls and show you some map-info on the go.

### Spotify API module based on https://github.com/FinianLandes/SpotifyEsp32
Modified for this project -> changed ip based URi to mDNS
